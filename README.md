# Claw Office

This OpenClaw feature plugin includes a typed draft-analysis operation, a model tool, a native page, and a composer replacement. The browser entry owns its DOM and uses the host's canonical draft and send operations.

## Build and install

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run validate
openclaw plugins install .
```

Installation applies the plugin in the running local Gateway. If the Gateway is stopped, start it to load the saved installation.

For native UI, enable **Settings > Labs > Custom plugin UI** (`gateway.controlUi.experimental.customPlugins: true`), then restart the Gateway and reload the browser tab. This setting is off by default; backend installation does not require it.

Select Claw Office in the Control UI sidebar. Open **Plugins > Customize UI** and choose Draft composer to try the replacement; choose Built-in to restore it.

For agent-requested activation, run `npm run pack`. The receipt contains the exact archive path and SHA-256 digest for `plugin_activate_artifact`. Approval applies to those bundled bytes and does not enable Custom plugin UI. The archive has no install scripts or package dependencies; backend activation applies through the running Gateway.

After browser-only changes, run the build again and use **Plugins > Customize UI > Reload plugin UI** as an administrator. After editing installed backend source, run `openclaw plugins reload claw-office`. Rebuild compiled code before reloading; for a copied installation, reinstall the rebuilt package. Plugin install and update commands apply changes through the running Gateway. Native plugins run trusted code in the Gateway and browser; install only code you trust.

Keep browser imports on the browser-safe `control-ui` and `feature-contract` SDK entrypoints. Bundle framework dependencies with the plugin. Return a dispose handle for DOM, subscriptions, and other resources; check the view's abort signal after asynchronous work.
